#+TITLE: mcp.el - TODO List

* Implementation Decisions

** JSON-RPC Implementation
- [X] Use built-in =jsonrpc.el= package (Emacs 27+) for JSON-RPC communication
  - Provides JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol support
  - Handles request/response tracking
  - Offers error handling mechanisms
  - Supports asynchronous communication
  - Manages connection lifecycle

** Transport Layer
- [X] Use =simple-httpd= package for HTTP transport
  - Server runs in a long-running Emacs session
  - Clients connect via HTTP to send/receive JSON-RPC messages
  - Easier debugging with standard HTTP tools
  - Potential for future extensions (WebSockets, SSE)
  - Better security options (TLS, authentication)

** Minimum Viable Implementation
- Focus on basic server + tool registration for initial release
- Defer resource and prompt implementation to future releases

* API Components to Implement

** Python SDK Parity (Based on Python SDK)
- [X] Server creation (`mcp-create-server`)
- [X] Server start/stop (`mcp-server-lib-start`, `mcp-server-lib-stop`)
- [X] Tool registration (`mcp-register-tool`)

* Implementation Tasks

** Core Implementation
- [X] Server instance representation (plist)
- [X] Tool registry data structure
  - [X] Support parameter descriptions for JSON Schema generation
  - [ ] Add JSON Schema type annotations for parameters
  - [ ] Remove incorrect listChanged capability from tools initialization
    - Currently returns listChanged: true when tools are registered
    - Should only be included if server actually sends notifications/tools/list_changed
    - We don't support sending these notifications yet
- [X] Resource registry data structure
- [ ] Prompt registry data structure
- [ ] Extract tools/list handler to separate function for consistency
  - Currently inline in dispatch function while resources handlers are extracted
  - Should follow same pattern as mcp-server-lib--handle-resources-list
- [X] Check whether prompts capability should be included in initialize response
  - Currently returns prompts: {} (empty object) even when prompts not supported
  - Should verify if MCP spec requires this field or if it can be omitted
  - Similar question for resources and tools capabilities when not implemented
- [ ] Fix initialize response to properly report resource capabilities
  - Currently always returns empty hash table for resources
  - Should return proper capability object when resources are registered
  - Similar pattern to tools capability handling
- [X] Stdio transport adapter script (emacs-mcp-stdio.sh)
  - [X] Handle JSON-RPC requests over stdin/stdout
  - [X] Support configurable socket, init and stop functions
  - [X] Add testing script (emacs-mcp-stdio-test.sh)
  - [X] Integrate with check.sh quality workflow
  - [X] Ensure script accessibility for external clients
    - [X] Add installation function to place script in user's PATH
    - [X] Update documentation with installation instructions
    - [ ] Consider environment variable for script location discovery
    - [X] Include script in proper location in package layout
- [ ] Server synchronization with MCP clients
- [X] Initialize method implementation
  - [X] Define `mcp--handle-initialize` function for the handshake process
  - [ ] Store client capabilities in server state
  - [X] Return server capabilities in response
  - [ ] Add connection lifecycle management
  - [X] Support capability-based feature negotiation

** Testing
- [X] Unit tests for basic server lifecycle
- [X] Unit tests for core protocol methods
- [ ] Add an error counter for JSON-RPC level errors
  - Track parse errors, invalid JSON-RPC format, etc.
  - These errors occur before method dispatch
  - Would allow monitoring transport-level issues
- [X] Test all interactive commands
  - The mcp-server-lib-test-interactive-commands test only checks start/stop
  - Should also test mcp-server-lib-install, mcp-server-lib-uninstall,
    mcp-server-lib-reset-metrics, mcp-server-lib-show-metrics
- [X] Unit tests for initialize handshake
  - [X] Test valid initialize request handling
  - [X] Test protocol version compatibility
  - [X] Test capability reporting
  - [X] Test initialized notification handling (including "notifications/initialized" format)
  - [X] Test error cases (invalid version, etc.)
- [X] Unit tests for tool registration and execution
  - [X] Add test for tools/list method
  - [X] Add test for tools/call method
- [X] Unit tests for resource handling
- [ ] Unit tests for prompt templating
- [ ] Integration tests with actual LLM clients (Claude, OpenAI, etc.)
- [X] Test fixtures and helper functions (mcp-test-jsonrpc-request)
- [ ] Protocol compliance improvements (common to tools and resources):
  - Both tools/call and resources/read use -32600 (Invalid Request) for "not found" errors
    - Should use -32602 (Invalid params) since request structure is valid
  - No parameter validation on either endpoint:
    - Don't validate that params is an object (not string, array, etc.)
    - Don't validate that required fields (name/uri) are strings
    - Don't validate that params exists at all
  - Nil handling is implicit through alist-get and gethash
  - No type checking on extracted parameter values
- [ ] Consider extracting tools/call handler for consistency
  - Large inline handler in dispatch function
  - Would match pattern of extracted resource handlers
  - Complex error handling logic could be better isolated
- [ ] Extract common pattern for building entries with optional fields
  - Both tools/list and resources/list use similar append patterns
  - Could have helper like (mcp-server-lib--build-entry base-alist &rest optional-pairs)
  - Would reduce duplication and make code more maintainable
- [X] Extract common reference counting logic
  - Both mcp-server-lib-register-tool and mcp-server-lib-register-resource have identical ref counting
  - Could have generic helpers for ref-counted registration/unregistration
  - Would ensure consistent behavior and reduce duplication

** CI and Linting
- [X] Fix package dependency issue (Package json is not installable)
- [X] Fix long lines exceeding fill-column (70 characters)
- [X] Fix indentation (use spaces instead of tabs as configured in .dir-locals.el)
- [X] Remove trailing whitespace
- [X] Fix checkdoc issues:
  - Add two spaces after periods
  - Quote Lisp symbols properly
  - Remove whitespace at end of lines
- [X] Fix naming convention (mcp--test-port â†’ mcp-test-port)
- [X] Add byte-compilation checks to test suite
- [X] Integrate elisp-lint into workflow
- [X] Add markdown linting for documentation files
- [X] Simplify Emacs test running in CI:
  - Update GitHub workflow elisp-test.yml to use simpler test command
  - Use consistent test command in CI and CLAUDE.md: emacs -Q --batch -l mcp-server-lib.el -l mcp-server-lib-test.el --eval "(ert-run-tests-batch-and-exit)"

** Documentation
- [ ] Complete package documentation (similar to Python SDK's documentation)
- [X] Usage examples
- [X] API reference documentation
- [X] Example server implementations
- [ ] Example integrations with Emacs packages (org-mode, etc.)
- [ ] Example client applications
