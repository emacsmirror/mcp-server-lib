# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working
with code in this repository. These guidelines build on the common user's
guidelines at ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md locally or
<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurynas-biveinis/dotfiles/refs/heads/master/ai/.claude/CLAUDE.md>
online.

User-facing documentation is in README.org.

This is an Elisp project, and should follow user's Elisp guidelines at
@~/.claude/CLAUDE-elisp.md.

A second copy of this package is present in user ELPA directory too, and Eask
does not isolate it well. Before any Elisp work, move the ELPA copy away, and
restore it after the work is completed.
